# Introduction
In a world where the web is constantly changing, it is important to be able to build applications that are flexible and adaptable to the changing needs of the web.

With this in mind, we have created a library that can be used to build a web application that is able to delivered faster and more efficiently than ever before.

[Federated Architecture's](/sections/architecture/federated-architecture.md) have been around for a long time, being used by many companies and organisations to build their authentication and backend systems, however they have largely been overlooked by web developers.

With the rise in popularity for [Micro Frontends](/sections/architecture/micro-frontends.md), there has been a trend in the industry to use [Federated Architecture](/sections/architecture/federated-architecture.md) to build their frontend systems. This is because it is a much more efficient way to build a web application than traditional web frameworks.

[Webpack 5](https://webpack.js.org/) supports Federated Architecture with its [Module Federation plugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/module-federation-plugin) and many companies have started to experiment with it to try to move their applications towards a less coupled and more modular structure.

Instead of just blindly using WebPack's implementation, we decided to learn from what was already out there and build our own which could be shaped and molded to fit our use-case and wouldn't bake us into a specific bundler (like webpack).

## What we aim to achieve?
- To build applications in a modular way
- To allow teams to deliver faster and more efficiently
- To have autonomous delivery squads building independently of each other
- To build a culture of collaboration
- To have a way to share code between teams
- To be scalable
- To be adaptive
